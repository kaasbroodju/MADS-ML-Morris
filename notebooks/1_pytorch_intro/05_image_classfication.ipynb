    "The workflow for a data science project will follow these lines:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Get and explore the data\n",
    "2. Build a model \n",
    "3. Train the model\n",
    "4. Save and predict\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Get and Explore the Data\n",
    "The first step can take quite some time; data quality is often something that needs to be checked, and correlations between data should often be explored and visualized.\n",
    "\n",
    "This step can be a full project on its own: you clean the data, make sure you can access it properly, and create visualizations and hypothesis to gain insight into the data that can be shown in a dashboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "The insight in the data is an essential ingredient for deciding on a model.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Build a model\n",
    "Based on domain knowledge and a first exploration of the data, a model can be selected.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, the relation between features and outcome is very obvious. You might have features that\n",
    "correlate very high with the outcome variable, and a domain expert confirms that the correlations make sense.\n",
    "\n",
    "If this is the case, you can often build a simple model. If you expect to have non-linear and complex interactions between the features,\n",
    "you could use a model that works with non-linear data like a SVM plus kernel, or a random forest.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have enough data (as a rule of thumb, a lower threshold of 1000 observations) you can consider a neural network architecture.\n",
    "If the expected complexity of the data is low, you can use a relative small network.\n",
    "If you have lots and lots of data with a high complexity, you should consider to increase the complexity of your model too.\n",
    "\n",
    "How you can build a model, and what suitable models are for different datatypes and situations, will be the subject of the whole course.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Train the model\n",
    "Once you created a model, it hasnt learned anything yet. The model must be trained to learn the right connections, a bit like a baby that has to learn about what works and what doesn't.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, I will introduce you to PyTorch. Another high level library is Tensorflow, which is used a lot too.\n",
    "While the interface is comparable, the Tensorflow syntax is a bit more high-level. While this can be an advantage, \n",
    "it also has a downside: at the moment you ever need to dive a bit deeper into the architecture itself, it is much harder to\n",
    "add something new with TensorFlow, compared to PyTorch.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Save and predict\n",
    "Finally, you will want to use the trained model to predict new observations."
